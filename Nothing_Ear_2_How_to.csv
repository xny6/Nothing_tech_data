What is the connection priority with devices when Dual Connection is enabled?,"Re-connection:
1. If Ear (2) has been paired with multiple devices, the earbuds will automatically connect to the device with the most recent connection when the charging case lid opens.
2. If Ear (2) reconnects by returning to the Bluetooth connection range, it will automatically connect to the device with the most recent connection.
Connection Priority:
1. When no audio (music, video, or call) is running on the two connected devices A & B, Ear (2) can be manually connected to device C to play audio.
2. When audio is running on only one device out of device A and device B, Ear (2) can replace the one without audio and manually connect to device C to play audio.
3. If device A or B is on a call, Ear (2) cannot set up a new connection with a third device."

When only device A is running music or video playback:
1) Ear (2) will switch to device B if there is an incoming call or if device B is making an outgoing call. Calls take priority with Dual Connection. 
Then after the call on device B ends, Ear (2) will resume the music/video playback from device A.
2) When device B starts playing music or video playback, Ear (2) will play audio from the first device running music or video service."
How do calls work when Dual Connection is enabled?,"If neither device A & B are in a call, Ear (2) will play call audio from the device that first receives an incoming call.
If device A has a call in progress, and you receive an incoming call on device B, Ear (2) will play the ringtone at the same time.
If device A hangs up, Ear (2) will switch the call audio to device B.
