Don't deplete your phone's battery before charging. Doing so frequently will reduce the life of the lithium battery.
2. Charge at a suitable temperature.
The ideal temperature for charging is between 15°C and 35°C.
3. Use the original charger. 
The original charger and cable ensure a stable output of voltage and current, guaranteeing charging speed and safety. Inferior chargers and cables may have hidden safety hazards.
4. Avoid using your phone when charging.
5. Use a slim phone case for charging or, if using a thick case, remove it for charging.
This is to avoid additional heating as the phone charges.  
6. Avoid overcharging.
If your phone is fully charged, the charger will be maintained in a full power state. This may cause battery deformation and leakage of fluid. The battery performance will also be significantly reduced.

Don't charge your phone for more than 12 hours. Unplug the charger when the phone is fully charged.
If you aren't using your phone for a long time, shut your phone down at around 40-80% power, place it in a cool and dry place and charge it regularly."
