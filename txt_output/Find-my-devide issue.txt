What can I do if my Watch Pro is unable to ring my phone using the find phone feature?	1. Make sure that your Watch Pro is connected to the CMF Watch app and to Bluetooth. 2. Check if the CMF Watch app has permission to run in the background and if it is always running in the background on your phone or other device. Some phones will clear applications, which can cause the app to be cleared and the Watch Pro to lose connection with the app. We recommend that you add the CMF Watch app to your app whitelist. 3. To use your Watch Pro, make sure that your mobile device is turned on. If your phone is turned off, your Watch Pro will not be able to use this feature.
