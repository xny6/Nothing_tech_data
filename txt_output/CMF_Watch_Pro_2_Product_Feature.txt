What is the Active Score?	What Is Active Score? 
Active Score, is a health metric that quantifies physical activity using heart rate data. It is calculated from your heart's response to exercise over a rolling 7-day period. This metric helps you gauge the intensity and effectiveness of your workouts. Aim for an Active Score of 100 each week to maintain good health.

Importantly, any amount of physical activity is better than none. Incremental increases in physical activity, even at low intensities, can contribute to health improvements by reducing sedentary time.

How Is It Calculated? 
The Active Score is tailored to individual profiles, including factors like age, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and recent exercise history over the last 7 days.
By performing physical activities while monitored by your smartwatch, you accumulate Active scores. Activities of higher intensity will generate more scores in less time, enhancing your score more efficiently.
As your Active Score grows, acquiring additional points becomes progressively challenging.

Why Is It Calculated On A 7-Day Basis? 
The Active Score offers a snapshot of your physical activity impact over a rolling 7-day period. This flexible system allows you to spread your activity throughout the week without the pressure of achieving a high level of exercise every single day. Accumulating scores is possible anytime within this period, although we recommend engaging in physical activities 2-3 times a week to optimize both your physical and mental well-being.






What is Training Load?	Training Load is an estimate of the physical stress exerted on your body during and after a workout, based on parameters such as training time, distance, and intensity. This metric directly relates to your body's fatigue level. 

After each workout, the Training Load can be calculated using the duration and heart rate of the exercise. By tracking the daily Training Load over seven days, you can observe fluctuations in your weekly Training Load curve.

Following a workout, physical fitness initially decreases but gradually increases with proper diet and sleep, often surpassing the original fitness level—a phenomenon known as supercompensation. To improve fitness, it's crucial to balance training and rest; continuous overloading can lead to suboptimal results.

Aerobic Training Effect (ATE) Ratings:
<1.0: Light activity or warm-up
1.0-1.9: Relaxed state (low intensity, helps in relaxation and recovery)
2.0-2.9: Basic training (maintains basic aerobic fitness)
3.0-3.9: Effective training (gradually enhances fitness)
4.0-4.9: Intensive training (promotes significant fitness improvement)
5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)

Anaerobic Training Effect (AnTE) Ratings:
<1.0: Light activity or warm-up
1.0-1.9: Light activation (awakens muscles with light intensity)
2.0-2.9: Maintenance level (maintains current muscle status)
3.0-3.9: Moderate improvement (enhances muscle strength)
4.0-4.9: Significant enhancement (promotes substantial fitness improvement)
5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)






What is Recovery Time?	Recovery Time indicates the duration required for you to fully recover your fitness before engaging in the next intense workout.
The recovery time is displayed immediately after each exercise session and counts down to help you evaluate when you are ready for high-intensity training again. This feature aids in planning your training schedule effectively. If you work out before fully recovering, the recovery time will accumulate.






What is WorkOut Detection?	1. On the watch, go to **Settings > Workout detection** and turn on the switch for automatic workout detection.
2. Once enabled, the device will notify you when it detects that you are exercising. You can either ignore the notification or tap to enter the corresponding workout mode.

Workout detection supports the following types and requires the corresponding continuous duration to identify the activity:

- Continuous running (indoor & outdoor): 3 minutes
- Continuous walking (indoor & outdoor): 10 minutes
- Continuous outdoor cycling: 10 minutes
