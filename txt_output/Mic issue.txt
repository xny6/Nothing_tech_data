What should I do if the microphone is malfunctioning?	If the microphone adds noise that makes it difficult for others to understand you during phone calls, try the following: 1. Ensure that you have the latest firmware installed. 2. Record audio and playback to test the mics. 3. Check and confirm that no dirt is blocking any of the 3 microphones. 4. Disconnect and reconnect the earbuds. 5. Reset the device.
