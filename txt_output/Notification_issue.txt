Why won't my Watch Pro receive message notifications?	How message push works: When the CMF Watch app is connected to your Watch Pro via Bluetooth, it will push notifications from the phone status bar to your Watch Pro, reminding you that there are new messages on your phone.When notification messages are not displayed on your phone's status bar (including apps that are not displayed because they are encrypted by the system), even if the apps on your phone receive new messages, the phone will not push the messages to your device. Here are some things you can try if you are not receiving reminders: 1. Make sure that the Watch Pro is connected to the CMF Watch app and to the phone's Bluetooth. 2. Ensure that display of messages on your phone's status bar is enabled.Go to notification management in your phone's notification settings, tap on the app you need notifications from, and select "Allow notifications". 3. Check the notification reminder settings in the CMF Watch app to see if the message reminder switch is turned on, and if the notifications for third-party apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook are enabled. 4. Check if permission to run in the background is enabled in the CMF Watch app - My - Permission to run in the background. 5. Complete the following operations in your phone's settings: - Go to "Background power consumption management"in your phone's system settings, select the CMF Watch app, and enable the "High background power consumption" setting. - Go to application and permission management in your phone's system settings, select the CMF Watch app, and enable the automatic startup setting. - Android users can enter the multi-task management interface (by swiping up from the bottom of the screen or clicking the button), and select the upper part of the CMF Watch app thumbnail in the interface to lock the CMF Watch app. Some phones automatically clean up background apps, which may cause Watch Pro to lose connection with the app. If you encounter this issue, it is recommended that you manually add the CMF Watch app to the background cleanup whitelist. For some phone models, you can do this by long-pressing the app icon >> App Info >> Battery >> Unrestricted. For the specific path, you will need to consult your phone manufacturer. Note: When your phone is in the chat interface, chat messages will not be pushed to Watch Pro.For example, if you are using your phone to chat on WhatsApp, WhatsApp messages will not be pushed to Watch Pro.






Why isn't my watch receiving message notifications?	Notification Push Principle:
When the CMF Watch app is connected to your device via Bluetooth, it pushes notifications from your phone's status bar to your device, alerting you to new messages. If notifications do not appear in the phone's status bar (including applications encrypted by the system), new messages received by the phone will not be pushed to your device.

If you are not able to receive notifications, try the following steps:

1. **Check Connections**:
- Ensure that the watch is connected to the CMF Watch app and that Bluetooth is connected to your phone.

2. **Allow Notifications**:
- Ensure that messages can be displayed in the phone's status bar. In your phone's notification management settings, tap on the app you need notifications from and set it to "Allow notifications."

3. **Check Notification Settings in CMF Watch App**:
- Ensure that message notifications are enabled in the CMF Watch app and that third-party applications like WhatsApp/Facebook have notification settings enabled.

4. **Background Running Permissions**:
- In the CMF Watch app, go to **My** > **Background Running Permissions** and ensure that background running permissions are enabled.

5. **Phone Settings**:
- In your phone's system settings, allow high background power consumption for the CMF Watch app.
- In the application and permission management section, allow the CMF Watch app to auto-start.

**Note**: When your phone is in an active chat interface, chat messages will not be pushed to the device. For example, if you are actively chatting on WhatsApp, WhatsApp messages will not be pushed to the device.
