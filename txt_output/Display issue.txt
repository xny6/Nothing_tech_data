How can I prevent the brightness from dimming when my Watch Pro switches to the AOD Watch Face?	Since turning on the always-on display (AOD) Watch Face will keep the screen on, it will affect the battery life. In order to improve the battery life, the AOD Watch Face's brightness is set to low brightness by default. Therefore, when the display switches to the AOD Watch Face, the backlight will switch, and the screen will appear to dim quickly.This is normal for all watches with the AOD feature. Please rest assured that your Watch Pro is functioning normally.
