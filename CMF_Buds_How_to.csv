How does the Buds' dual-connectivity feature work?,"1. When the charging case is opened, the earphones will automatically power on and reconnect. 1.1 If you have less than two devices connected and the Buds are powered on, they will auto-reconnect in the state of dual connectivity. The reconnect targets the last two connected devices. If it's the first time the earphones are enabling dual connectivity and there are no previous reconnect records, the earphones will stay in single-device connection mode (no pairing occurs and the pairing process for new devices needs to be manually triggered by the user holding down the button). If the earphones fail to reconnect to other devices, they will remain in single-device connection mode (no pairing). 1.2. If the earphones are out of range, auto-reconnection will only work for the phone that was out of range. 1.3. Auto-reconnection will not be triggered when the earphones are in an active state (during a call or music playback). 1.4. If the earphones are in the process of auto-reconnection and in an active state (during a call or music playback), the earphones will pause the auto-reconnect for 5 seconds. If the active state is exited within the reconnect timeout, the earphones will resume the paused auto-reconnect until the reconnect timeout is reached (calculated from the first auto-reconnect trigger). 2. Connection priority (connection snatch): When in dual-connectivity mode, the earphones can be snatched by another device and the following applies: 2.1. When neither of the two connected phones is in music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the initially connected phone and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2.2. When the earphones enter pairing mode with a new device, and if they are currently connected to two devices, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices during the pairing process. After one of the devices has been disconnected, it becomes discoverable and can be connected to the new device. 2.3 If the earphones are currently connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a connection snatch, the earphones will disconnect from one of the connected devices. After disconnecting from one device, it can be snatched by the third device initiating the connection snatch. Note: 1. Music playback: 1.1 If one of the two connected phones is in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone not in the music playback state and then connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 1.2 If both phones are in the music playback state, the earphones will disconnect from the phone that is not producing sound (i.e. the device in a muted music playback state) and connect to the device initiating the connection snatch. 2. Call State: 2.1 If any of the two connected phones is in a call state, connection snatching will not occur."
