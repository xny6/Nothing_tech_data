How to use LDAC？,"LDAC high-definition audio can be understood as a ""highway"" between your phone and earphones, supporting 24-bit depth, 96kHz sampling rate, and a 990kbps streaming rate. The high transmission bitrate ensures that high-resolution audio files are not excessively compressed, retaining more musical details and significantly enhancing sound quality.

Note: This high-definition audio requires phone support and that the selected codec is enabled on the phone.

For Android Phones:
1. Ensure your phone supports LDAC by checking if it is enabled by default. If not, go to Settings > Developer Options to check for LDAC support.

2.If your phone supports LDAC, enable it in the settings.

3. Connect the earbuds to the Nothing X app.In the app, go to Device Settings.Enable High-Quality Audio to activate LDAC high-definition audio encoding.

Tips for Optimal LDAC Performance:
- To ensure smooth playback, set LDAC playback quality to default adaptive in the phone's developer options.
- If opting for higher quality audio bitrate, it is recommended to disable the dual connection feature to ensure sufficient bandwidth for LDAC high-quality streaming.

*Note: iOS devices only support the AAC high-quality audio codec over Bluetooth and currently do not support other high-quality audio codecs like LDAC."

How to Manage Dual Connection and Connection Priority on CMF Buds Pro 2,"1. Reconnection on Lid Open:
1) When dual connection is enabled and the earbuds are powered on, if the earbuds are connected to fewer than two devices, they will attempt to reconnect to the last two connected devices. If dual connection is enabled for the first time with no previous reconnection records, the earbuds will maintain a single-device connection (in single connection mode, the earbuds will not automatically enter pairing mode; pairing a new device requires a manual long-press of the button). If reconnection to other devices fails, the earbuds will stay connected to a single device and will not enter pairing mode.

2) If the earbuds and the terminal device exceed the connection range and then return within range, the earbuds will only reconnect to the phone that was disconnected due to distance.

3) Reconnection will not be triggered when the earbuds are in a call or music state.

4) If the earbuds are in a reconnection state and a call or music scenario occurs, the earbuds will pause reconnection for 5 seconds. If the call or music ends within the reconnection timeout period, the earbuds will resume the paused reconnection until the timeout. After the reconnection timeout, the connection can only be initiated from the device end.

2. Connection Priority:
When the earbuds are in dual connection mode, connection priority follows these principles:
1) If neither of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the first connected phone and connect to the device initiating the snatch.
2) When the earbuds enter pairing mode and are already connected to two devices, they will disconnect from one of the devices to be searchable and connectable.
3) If the earbuds are already connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a snatch, the earbuds will disconnect from one of the devices and connect to the third device.

Tips:

Music State:
1. If one of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone that is not in the music state and connect to the device initiating the snatch.
2. If both phones are in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone whose music is not outputting through the earbuds (i.e., disconnect the device in the muted music state) and connect to the device initiating the snatch.

Call State:
1. If any phone is in a call state, connection snatch is not allowed."
