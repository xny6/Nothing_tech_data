Why can't I use the Nothing X app to connect to Ear (open) while on a call with an iOS device?	This is normal. When connected to an iOS device, the Bluetooth connection through the app uses the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol. The earbuds and the app establish a connection via low-power Bluetooth. During a call, the system prioritises processing power and communication bandwidth for the call as priority. Therefore, the communication over low-power Bluetooth is halted.

Why can't I switch to the previous or next song using gesture control?	Make sure you're touching the correct area on the earbuds. If the touch controls still don't work, try switching to a different music app to test if the feature functions properly.

The touch commands are processed through this path: Earbuds > Device > App. Some apps may not support these control commands, which could result in the touch controls not responding.

Please rest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with CMF earbuds.






I have set CMF earbuds to use gestures for volume control. Why is this not working?	Rest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with CMF earbuds. Due to compatibility issues with Bluetooth protocol versions of devices, some phone and computer models may not support the volume control protocol. If you encounter this issue, try connecting the earbuds to another commonly used device to adjust the volume.






Why can't I switch to the previous or next song using gesture control?	When the gesture function is triggered, it sends commands through to the app for processing. However, as some apps don't support switching commands, they won't respond to the earbuds' control commands, leading to ineffective gesture control. Rest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with Ear (open).

Please also ensure you're pressing the correct control area on the earbuds. If still unable to trigger the function, try switching to a different music app to see if the function works.






I have set Ear (open) to use gestures for volume control. Why is this not working?	Rest assured this doesn't indicate any fault with Ear (open). Due to compatibility issues with Bluetooth protocol versions of devices, some phone and computer models may not support the volume control protocol. If you encounter this issue, try connecting the earbuds to another commonly used device to adjust the volume. If the issue doesn't persist, it means the device, not Ear (open), needs checking.

How do I manage dual connection and connection priority on CMF earbuds？	1. Reconnection on lid open:
a) If the earbuds are connected to fewer than two devices, with dual connection enabled and the earbuds are powered on, they will attempt to reconnect to the last two connected devices. If dual connection is enabled for the first time with no previous reconnection records, the earbuds will maintain a single-device connection. (In single connection mode, the earbuds will not automatically enter pairing mode; pairing a new device requires a manual long-press of the button.) If reconnection to other devices fails, the earbuds will stay connected to a single device and will not enter pairing mode.

b) If the earbuds and the terminal device exceed the connection range and then return within range, the earbuds will only reconnect to the phone that was disconnected due to distance.

c) Reconnection will not be triggered when the earbuds are in a call or music state.

d) If the earbuds are in a reconnection state and a call or music scenario occurs, the earbuds will pause reconnection for 5 seconds. If the call or music ends within the reconnection timeout period, the earbuds will resume the paused reconnection until the timeout. After the reconnection timeout, the connection can only be initiated from the device end.

2. Connection priority:
When the earbuds are in dual connection mode, connection priority follows these principles:
a) If neither of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the first connected phone and connect to the device initiating the snatch.
b) When the earbuds enter pairing mode and are already connected to two devices, they will disconnect from one of the devices to be searchable and connectable.
c) If the earbuds are already connected to two devices, and a third device with a connection record initiates a snatch, the earbuds will disconnect from one of the devices and connect to the third device.

Tips:

Music state:
1. If one of the two phones is in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone that is not in the music state and connect to the device initiating the snatch.
2. If both phones are in a music state, the earbuds will disconnect from the phone whose music is not outputting through the earbuds (i.e., disconnect the device in the muted music state) and connect to the device initiating the snatch.

Call state:
1. If any phone is in a call state, connection snatch is not allowed.

*The dual connection feature supports connecting to two devices via classic Bluetooth (as shown in the Bluetooth settings of your devices). However, the Nothing X app can only connect to one device at a time. If you need to switch the Nothing X app to another device, please disconnect it from the current device first.

What is the Smart ANC Algorithm?	The Smart ANC algorithm automatically detects the current wearing status and external noise leakage through the earphones' in-ear detection whenever the earphones are in ANC ON mode. After detection, the earphones will automatically generate corresponding noise reduction parameters to optimize the current noise cancellation effect, providing the best noise cancellation experience for the user. This entire process runs automatically without user intervention.

The algorithm operates under specific conditions; if the conditions are not met, the algorithm will not be triggered and will default to running with fixed strong noise reduction parameters. This ensures that the basic noise cancellation experience remains unaffected, so you can use it with confidence.

For the algorithm to function correctly, please ensure the following conditions are met during wear:
1. The default noise cancellation state after wearing needs to be ANC ON: You can switch to ANC ON state through the app or pressure-sensitive controls after wearing, then remove and re-wear the earphones to trigger the in-ear detection and the Smart ANC algorithm.
2. To achieve noticeable noise cancellation improvement, ensure the ambient noise level is >65dB when triggering the detection.
3. Avoid swallowing movements during the detection process.

If you notice a difference in noise cancellation, you can remove and re-wear the earphones under the above conditions to trigger the algorithm detection.

What is the Active Score?	What Is Active Score? 
Active Score, is a health metric that quantifies physical activity using heart rate data. It is calculated from your heart's response to exercise over a rolling 7-day period. This metric helps you gauge the intensity and effectiveness of your workouts. Aim for an Active Score of 100 each week to maintain good health.

Importantly, any amount of physical activity is better than none. Incremental increases in physical activity, even at low intensities, can contribute to health improvements by reducing sedentary time.

How Is It Calculated? 
The Active Score is tailored to individual profiles, including factors like age, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and recent exercise history over the last 7 days.
By performing physical activities while monitored by your smartwatch, you accumulate Active scores. Activities of higher intensity will generate more scores in less time, enhancing your score more efficiently.
As your Active Score grows, acquiring additional points becomes progressively challenging.

Why Is It Calculated On A 7-Day Basis? 
The Active Score offers a snapshot of your physical activity impact over a rolling 7-day period. This flexible system allows you to spread your activity throughout the week without the pressure of achieving a high level of exercise every single day. Accumulating scores is possible anytime within this period, although we recommend engaging in physical activities 2-3 times a week to optimize both your physical and mental well-being.






What is Training Load?	Training Load is an estimate of the physical stress exerted on your body during and after a workout, based on parameters such as training time, distance, and intensity. This metric directly relates to your body's fatigue level. 

After each workout, the Training Load can be calculated using the duration and heart rate of the exercise. By tracking the daily Training Load over seven days, you can observe fluctuations in your weekly Training Load curve.

Following a workout, physical fitness initially decreases but gradually increases with proper diet and sleep, often surpassing the original fitness level—a phenomenon known as supercompensation. To improve fitness, it's crucial to balance training and rest; continuous overloading can lead to suboptimal results.

Aerobic Training Effect (ATE) Ratings:
<1.0: Light activity or warm-up
1.0-1.9: Relaxed state (low intensity, helps in relaxation and recovery)
2.0-2.9: Basic training (maintains basic aerobic fitness)
3.0-3.9: Effective training (gradually enhances fitness)
4.0-4.9: Intensive training (promotes significant fitness improvement)
5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)

Anaerobic Training Effect (AnTE) Ratings:
<1.0: Light activity or warm-up
1.0-1.9: Light activation (awakens muscles with light intensity)
2.0-2.9: Maintenance level (maintains current muscle status)
3.0-3.9: Moderate improvement (enhances muscle strength)
4.0-4.9: Significant enhancement (promotes substantial fitness improvement)
5.0: Extreme challenge (high-risk, requires full recovery)






What is Recovery Time?	Recovery Time indicates the duration required for you to fully recover your fitness before engaging in the next intense workout.
The recovery time is displayed immediately after each exercise session and counts down to help you evaluate when you are ready for high-intensity training again. This feature aids in planning your training schedule effectively. If you work out before fully recovering, the recovery time will accumulate.

LDAC high-definition audio can be likened to a "highway" between your phone and earbuds, supporting streaming rates of 990 kbps and a sample rate of 96 kHz with a bit depth of 24-bit. The high transmission bit rate allows high-resolution audio files to be less compressed, retaining more music details and noticeably improving sound quality.

*This high-definition audio requires support from the paired device, and the selected codec needs to be activated on the device to take effect.

For Android phones, first check if LDAC is enabled by default on your phone. If not, go to [Settings > Developer Options] to see if LDAC is supported. If your phone supports it, activate the phone's LDAC and make sure high-definition encoding is turned on in the Nothing X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encoding.
*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is advised to turn off dual connection functionality to ensure there is enough bandwidth for the LDAC high-definition stream.
*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth high-quality audio codec, for the time being, they cannot support other high-quality audio codecs.

What is Ear (a) made of?	The construction features a plastic housing, silicone ear tips and a stainless steel hinge. The plastic shell is crafted from high-quality materials, providing lasting resistance to UV exposure and excellent impact resistance.






How many devices can Ear (a) be paired with？	Ear (a) can store records for up to 8 devices at maximum capacity.






What is Bass Enhance?	The algorithm dynamically detects low-frequency signals in music, enhancing the impression of low frequencies in real-time to deliver a more powerful and dynamic bass experience.

Users can also adjust the low-frequency intensity based on their listening preferences in the Nothing X app, defining their own high-definition bass experience. Additional options available in the Nothing X app.






What is "Adaptive" in Noise Control?	Adaptive Mode monitors the noisiness of your environment and adjusts the noise cancellation accordingly, for the optimum audio experience.






What is Smart ANC?	The Smart ANC algorithm can automatically detect the level of external noise leakage whenever the earbuds are placed in the ears with ANC Mode on. This is influenced by ear-insertion behaviour during wear. Following the completion of the detection, the earbuds generate noise reduction parameters tailored to optimise the current noise-canceling effect, providing users with the optimum noise-canceling experience. This process runs automatically without user intervention, adapting to usage conditions.

*The algorithm's operation is contingent on certain scenario conditions, and will not be activated if not fulfilled. If not activated, a default strong noise cancellation with fixed parameters will run, which will not affect the fundamental noise cancellation experience, ensuring reliable use.
**To ensure the algorithm operates correctly, please pay attention to the following conditions during wear:
1. After wearing the earbuds, the default noise cancellation state should be in ANC ON: You may switch to ANC ON through the app or a pressure-sensitive control after wearing, then take off and re-wear the earbuds to initiate the in-ear detection and activate the Smart ANC algorithm.
2. For significant noise cancellation improvement, the environmental noise should be greater than 65 dB when detection is triggered by wearing.
3. Refrain from swallowing actions while wearing the earbuds.

If you perceive a difference in noise cancellation effectiveness, you can remove the earbuds and put them back in under the above conditions to prompt the algorithm.






Will the earbuds charge properly when the charging case is in low-battery status?	The earbuds will charge until the charging case falls below 5% battery.

What is the device?   The device is Nothing Ear, an eraphone.









How do I use the LHDC feature?	LHDC 5.0 can be understood as the "highway" between your phone and earbuds. It supports 24 bit/192 kHz high-resolution audio streaming transmission. The transmission rate can reach up to 1 Mbps, which is about 4 times that of the traditional SBC encoder (328Kbps). The high-resolution audio file will not be over-compressed, so more music details can be retained, and the sound quality will be significantly improved.
*High-quality audio settings need to be supported by the phone and the selected codec must be enabled on the phone to take effect.

For Nothing phones, the LHDC Bluetooth audio codec function is turned on by default. After the user connects the headset using Nothing OS, LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission is enabled by default. Users can operate the headset in the Nothing X app to turn on or off LHDC audio encoding.
For non-Nothing Android phones, you can check whether the phone supports LHDC in the Bluetooth Audio Codec settings of the phone. If the phone supports it, turn on the phone's LHDC in the settings and confirm that LHDC is checked in the HD encoding options of the Nothing X app. LHDC high-quality Bluetooth audio transmission will be turned on.
*To ensure smooth playback of LHDC high-definition audio, it is recommended to turn off the Dual Connection function when using this function to ensure sufficient bandwidth for the LHDC high-definition stream.
*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth codec, other high-quality audio codecs are not currently supported.






How to use the LDAC feature?	LDAC high-definition audio can be likened to a "highway" between the phone and headphones, supporting streaming rates of 990kbps and a sample rate of 96kHz with a bit depth of 24-bit. The high transmission bit rate allows high-resolution audio files to be less compressed, retaining more music details and noticeably improving sound quality.
*This high-definition audio requires support from the phone and the selected codec needs to be activated on the device to take effect.

For Android phones, first check if LDAC is enabled by default on your phone. If not, go to [Settings – Developer Options] to see if LDAC is supported. If your phone supports it, activate the phone's LDAC and make sure high-definition encoding is turned on in the Nothing X app, thus enabling LDAC high-definition audio encodinг.
*To ensure smooth playback of LDAC high-definition audio, it is recommended that when using this feature, 1) the default LDAC playback quality in the developer options is set to adaptive; 2) if the phone chooses a higher quality audio stream, it is advised to turn off dual connection functionality to ensure there is enough bandwidth for the LDAC high-definition stream.
*Since iOS devices only support the AAC Bluetooth high-quality audio codec, for the time being, they cannot support other high-quality audio codecs.

How can I extend my phone's battery life?	See our tips below:

1. Charge your phone regularly.
Don't deplete your phone's battery before charging. Doing so frequently will reduce the life of the lithium battery.
2. Charge at a suitable temperature.
The ideal temperature for charging is between 15°C and 35°C.
3. Use the original charger. 
The original charger and cable ensure a stable output of voltage and current, guaranteeing charging speed and safety. Inferior chargers and cables may have hidden safety hazards.

If your phone is fully charged, the charger will be maintained in a full power state. This may cause battery deformation and leakage of fluid. The battery performance will also be significantly reduced.

Don't charge your phone for more than 12 hours. Unplug the charger when the phone is fully charged.
If you aren't using your phone for a long time, shut your phone down at around 40-80% power, place it in a cool and dry place and charge it regularly.

Why won't my Watch Pro receive message notifications?	How message push works: When the CMF Watch app is connected to your Watch Pro via Bluetooth, it will push notifications from the phone status bar to your Watch Pro, reminding you that there are new messages on your phone.When notification messages are not displayed on your phone's status bar (including apps that are not displayed because they are encrypted by the system), even if the apps on your phone receive new messages, the phone will not push the messages to your device. Here are some things you can try if you are not receiving reminders: 1. Make sure that the Watch Pro is connected to the CMF Watch app and to the phone's Bluetooth. 2. Ensure that display of messages on your phone's status bar is enabled.Go to notification management in your phone's notification settings, tap on the app you need notifications from, and select "Allow notifications". 3. Check the notification reminder settings in the CMF Watch app to see if the message reminder switch is turned on, and if the notifications for third-party apps such as WhatsApp or Facebook are enabled. 4.

My phone is heating up. What can I do?	Phone use environment
Phones are generally suitable for use in an environment with a temperature between 0 and 35°C. Temperatures higher or lower than that can affect the operation of the phone, causing overheating and charging issues. In severe cases, they may cause damage to the phone and battery.

Advice:
- Don't use your phone for a long time in a high-temperature environment, especially in summer. When the outdoor temperature is high, the phone is prone to heating.
- When the phone is charging or the temperature rises, take off the case and leave the phone for some time with the screen off. Choose thin and breathable phone cases rather than heavy ones (leather or metal cases).
- Choose a qualified phone radiator with good heat dissipation and cooling performance, or use a wet tissue to put on the back of the mobile phone to help dissipate heat.

Heating usage scenario:
1. High-power consumption scenarios
a) The signal is weak
When the WiFi signal and SIM signal are weak, the device will increase the power of transmitting and receiving signals (currently, 5G base station coverage is incomplete, and the network signal is poor in some areas, resulting in increased power consumption and heat generation of mobile phones when using 5G).
b) Play games
To ensure game image quality and smoothness, phone CPU, GPU and other chips need to operate at high performance. The network needs to communicate with the game server in real time. In addition, the screen and speakers work at the same time. The device is running with a high load, and the temperature of the phone will rise accordingly (generally reaches maximum temperature after 20 minutes).
c) Watch videos
The phone screen, data processor and image processor are in a long-term working state. For example, when playing videos or live broadcasts, high-resolution and streaming comments will increase power consumption and generate more heat.
d) Many backgrounds
If there are too many apps running in the background, or if the phone has WiFi, GPS, NFC, Bluetooth and other functions searching for signals or networks in the background, it will easily become overheated.

2. When charging your mobile phone:
Charging is an energy conversion process. The charging equipment generates a certain amount of heat during operation, causing both the phone and the charger to heat up. This is normal. Phones that support fast charging generate more heat during charging.

Suggestion:
a) Be sure to use the official charger. Don't place the phone in a high-temperature environment with poor heat dissipation when charging.
b) Avoid playing with your phone while charging. If the phone continues to run during charging, it will increase the load on the phone's CPU and increase heat.

Note:
- The phone needs hardware to cooperate during operation. When working, it will inevitably generate heat.
- If the phone heats up inexplicably, turn it off for some time and restart it. If the issue persists, contact our Customer Service or go to the repair center designated by Nothing for testing with your purchase invoice, warranty card and phone.






The battery has dropped quickly. What can I do? Plus, how do I check my phone's power consumption?	Please try the below:

1. Fast power consumption in a low-temperature environment:
Lithium batteries deteriorate in low-temperature environments, resulting in increased power consumption, which is normal. When the temperature returns to normal, the power consumption normalises, too.
2. Fast power consumption with 5G network:
When the phone uses the 5G network, the 4G network will be turned on simultaneously, so the power consumption will increase, too. You can turn it on or off as you need. (Path: Settings > Network & internet > SIMs > Preferred network type.
3. Fast power consumption after a system update:
Due to system integration and optimisation, power consumption increases after a system update. We recommend restarting the phone after the screen is off and charging it for a whole night after that. It will recover by itself after 2-3 days of normal use.
4. Check the power consumption details of the phone:
Go to Settings > Battery > Battery usage on your phone to check the power consumption details.






My phone isn't charging. What can I do?	Please try the below:

1. Check whether the charger is working properly
Connect the charger to other devices and check whether the charger is charging other devices properly. If not, it means the charger is defective and needs replacing.
Please note: Some chargers may have compatibility issues. We recommend using a mainstream charger.
2. If the charger isn't defective, please:
1) Replace the cable to check if it can be fixed.
2) Check whether there is any foreign matter in the charging port of the phone. If so, clean it with a dry brush or other small tools.
3) Please ensure that the ambient temperature is suitable during the charging process. If the temperature is too high, it will trigger the high-temperature protection and stop charging.

If the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.






The charging speed is slow or my phone won't charge fully. What can I do?	Please try the below:

1. We recommend using the official Nothing charger and cable.
2. Replace the charger and cable to check if the adapter or cable is defective.
3. Avoid using high-power apps when charging, especially games, videos, camera, etc. If your phone is seriously overheated, restart it and wait for the temperature to drop before charging again.
4. If the ambient temperature is too high or too low, it will affect the phone's charging speed. Charge the phone in a suitable environment of 15℃~35℃.
5. Restart your phone and re-plug and unplug the cable to try charging.

If the issue persists, contact our Customer Support for further assistance.
